        <p class="direction">Exeunt all but Marco and Giuseppe</p>
        <p class="song">Take a pair of sparkling eyes,
            Hidden, ever and anon,
                 In a merciful eclipse—
       Do not heed their mild surprise—
            Having passed the Rubicon,
                 Take a pair of rosy lips;
       Take a figure trimly planned—
            Such as admiration whets—
                 (Be particular in this);
       Take a tender little hand,
            Fringed with dainty fingerettes,
                 Press it—in parenthesis;—
       Ah! Take all these, you lucky man—
       Take and keep them, if you can!
