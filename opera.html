<h4>Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h4>
<p> FIA.           Though obedience is strong,
            Curiosity's stronger—
       We waited for long,
            Till we couldn't wait longer.

VIT.           It's imprudent, we know,
            But without your society
       Existence was slow,
            And we wanted variety—

BOTH.     Existence was slow, and we wanted variety.

ALL.      So here we are, at the risk of our lives,
  From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—
  And to that end we've crossed the main,
  And don't intend to return again!

(Enter Gianetta and Tessa.  They rush to the arms of Marco and
Giuseppe.)

GIU.      Tessa!
TESS.          Giuseppe!      {All embrace.}
GIA.      Marco!
MAR.           Gianetta!

               TESSA and GIANETTA.

TESS.          After sailing to this island—
GIA.                Tossing in a manner frightful,
TESS.          We are all once more on dry land—
GIA.                And we find the change delightful,
TESS.          As at home we've been remaining—
            We've not seen you both for ages,
GIA.           Tell me, are you fond of reigning?—
            How's the food, and what's the wages?
TESS.          Does your new employment please ye?—
GIA.                How does Royalizing strike you?
TESS.          Is it difficult or easy?—
GIA.                Do you think your subjects like you?
TESS.          I am anxious to elicit,
            Is it plain and easy steering?
GIA.           Take it altogether, is it
            Better fun than gondoliering?
BOTH.          We shall both go on requesting
            Till you tell us, never doubt it;
       Everything is interesting,
            Tell us, tell us all about it!

CHORUS.        They will both go on requesting, etc.

TESS.          Is the populace exacting?
GIA.                Do they keep you at a distance?
TESS.          All unaided are you acting,
GIA.                Or do they provide assistance?
TESS.          When you're busy, have you got to
            Get up early in the morning?
GIA.           If you do what you ought not to,
            Do they give the usual warning?
TESS.          With a horse do they equip you?
GIA.                Lots of trumpeting and drumming?
TESS.          Do the Royal tradesmen tip you?
GIA.                Ain't the livery becoming!

<p>  Take a pair of sparkling eyes,
    Hidden, ever and anon,
         In a merciful eclipse—
Do not heed their mild surprise—
    Having passed the Rubicon,
         Take a pair of rosy lips;
Take a figure trimly planned—
    Such as admiration whets—
         (Be particular in this);
Take a tender little hand,
    Fringed with dainty fingerettes,
         Press it—in parenthesis;—
Ah! Take all these, you lucky man—
Take and keep them, if you can!

Take a pretty little cot—
    Quite a miniature affair—
         Hung about with trellised vine,
Furnish it upon the spot
    With the treasures rich and rare
         I've endeavoured to define.
Live to love and love to live—
    You will ripen at your ease,
         Growing on the sunny side—
Fate has nothing more to give.
    You're a dainty man to please
         If you are not satisfied.
Ah! Take my counsel, happy man;
Act upon it, if you can!</p>
<p>making merry On a bun and glass of sherry</p>
<p>And it generally happens that he hasn't far to go</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Marco and Giuseppe</p>
<p>Enter Chorus of Contadine, running in, led by Fiametta and
Vittoria.  They are met by all the Ex-Gondoliers, who welcome
them heartily.</p>
<p>Enter Gianetta and Tessa.  They rush to the arms of Marco and Giuseppe.</p>
<p>The dance is interrupted by the unexpected appearance of Don
Alhambra, who looks on with astonishment.  Marco and Giuseppe
appear embarrassed.  The others run off, except Drummer Boy, who
is driven off by Don Alhambra.</p>
<p>And he was rich as rich could be</p>
<p>Gianetta and Tessa enter unobserved.  The two girls, impelled by
curiosity, remain listening at the back of the stage</p>
<p>Exit Don Alhambra</p>
<p>March.  Enter procession of Retainers, heralding approach of
Duke, Duchess, and Casilda.  All three are now dressed with the
utmost magnificence</p>
