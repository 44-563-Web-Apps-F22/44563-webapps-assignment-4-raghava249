        <h3>The Gondoliers </h3>
        <h4>The Piazzetta, Venice</h4>
        <p>  CHORUS.                                 Alas!

            FIA.           Are four-and-twenty,
                           They, alas!
          
            CHORUS.                                 Alas!
          
            FIA.           Are only two.
          
            CHORUS.        They, alas, are only two, alas!
                           Now ye know, ye dainty roses,
                           Roses white and roses red,
                           Why we bind you into posies,
                                Ere your morning bloom has fled,
                                Roses white and roses red!
          
            (During this chorus Antonio, Francesco, Giorgio, and other
            Gondoliers have entered unobserved by the Girlsâ€”at first two,
            then two more, then four, then half a dozen, then the remainder
            of the Chorus.)
          
                                          SOLI.
          
            FRANC.    Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye
                      These floral tributes extraordinary?
          
            FIA.      For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
                      The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.
          
            GIU.      They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
                      To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.
          
            ANT.      Do all you maidens love them?
          
            ALL.                                    Passionately!
          
            ANT.      These gondoliers are to be envied greatly!
          
            GIOR.     But what of us, who one and all adore you?
                      Have pity on our passion, we implore you!
          
            FIA.      These gentlemen must make their choice before you;
